# MNIST_classification
The data used for this project was already pretty much cleaned, X and y have been defined after dropping 3 columns and selecting the labels as our y. Three algorithms have been used to classify the handwritten digits found in the MNIST dataset, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, Gauss Bayes, and K nearest neighbours.
The highest results have been obtained with Gauss Bayes, that reached 95.63% in the testing stage.
